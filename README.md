Current functionality:
Reads how many people you're setting up with, figures out what kind of mixup you want, and creates a schedule \n
Keeps track of wins/losses/goal diff/team stats \n
Keeps track of what games are next \n
After mixup is done, sends the stats to the chat, writes the stats to a text file in /results/ \n
stat sending/writing is a bit buggy, tracking seems close to correct, reporting probably isn't write \n
\n\n
Things to do: \n
Probs fix that stuff above \n
Maybe make it give people more shit \n
Maybe change it to accessing a google doc instead of a txt file \n
open to any and all suggestions \n
