Current functionality:
Reads how many people you're setting up with, figures out what kind of mixup you want, and creates a schedule

Keeps track of wins/losses/goal diff/team stats

Keeps track of what games are next

After mixup is done, sends the stats to the chat, writes the stats to a text file in /results/

stat sending/writing is a bit buggy, tracking seems close to correct, reporting probably isn't write


Things to do: 

Probs fix that stuff above

Maybe make it give people more shit

Maybe change it to accessing a google doc instead of a txt file

open to any and all suggestions
